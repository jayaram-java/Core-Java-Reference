Dependency injection : 

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development 
to reduce tight coupling between components, making the code more flexible, 
testable, and maintainable.


Types of Dependency Injection:

Constructor Injection – via constructor
Setter Injection – via setter method
Field Injection – directly into fields (used in frameworks like Spring)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- AOP

AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) in Spring is a programming paradigm that helps you separate cross-cutting concerns 
(like logging, security, or transactions) 
from the core business logic.

AOP lets you add extra behavior (like logging, security checks, etc.) 
before or after a method runs, without changing the method's code.

Logging
Security
Transaction management
Performance monitoring
Exception handling
