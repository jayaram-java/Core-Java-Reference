What is Spring Security?

Spring Security is a powerful authentication and authorization framework 
for Java applications. It protects applications against common security threats 
like CSRF, session fixation, and unauthorized access.

What are Authentication and Authorization?

Authentication → Verifying who you are (username & password)
Authorization → Verifying what you can access (roles/permissions)

What are the main features of Spring Security?

Authentication & Authorization
Password encoding
CSRF protection
Session management
Method-level security
OAuth2 & JWT support

What is SecurityFilterChain?

It is a chain of servlet filters that intercept every HTTP request 
and apply security rules like authentication and authorization.

What is UserDetailsService?

It is used to load user-specific data 
(username, password, roles) during authentication.

What is AuthenticationManager?

It is the core interface that processes authentication 
requests and delegates them to AuthenticationProvider.

What is AuthenticationProvider?

It performs the actual authentication 
logic (e.g., validating username/password).

What is PasswordEncoder?

Used to encrypt passwords.
Common implementations:
BCryptPasswordEncoder  (recommended)
NoOpPasswordEncoder  (not secure)

What is CSRF? How does Spring Security handle it?

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tricks users into submitting malicious requests.
Spring Security:
Enables CSRF protection by default
Uses a CSRF token for validation

What is @EnableMethodSecurity?

Used to enable method-level authorization using annotations like:
@PreAuthorize
@PostAuthorize
@Secured

What is JWT?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a stateless authentication mechanism 
where user info is stored in a token sent with each request.

| Session               | JWT                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Server stores session | Stateless                 |
| Uses cookies          | Uses Authorization header |
| Scales poorly         | Scales well               |

What is OAuth2?

OAuth2 is an authorization framework allowing third-party apps
to access resources without sharing passwords.

What is OncePerRequestFilter?

A filter that runs only once per request, commonly used for JWT validation.

What is CORS?

CORS allows/restricts cross-domain requests.

Spring Security handles it via:
http.cors();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do you disable Spring Security for specific URLs?

http.authorizeHttpRequests()
    .requestMatchers("/login", "/public/**").permitAll()
    .anyRequest().authenticated();

How do you secure REST APIs?
Use JWT
Disable sessions
Disable CSRF (for stateless APIs)

How do you handle logout?
http.logout()
    .logoutUrl("/logout")
    .invalidateHttpSession(true);
